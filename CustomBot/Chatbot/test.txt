Welcome to University Advancement: Philanthropy is vitally important to the mission of Cal State LA.  Your generosity enables the University to continue its forward momentum to be internationally recognized as the premier comprehensive public university in greater Los Angeles. You provide the critical support that guides our mission and ensures academic success, and we are grateful.  Ranked #1 in the United States for upward mobility, Cal State LA continues to shape the future of our country. Together with alumni, friends, faculty, staff and students, you make a powerful impact.  Thanks to you, in the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2017, we raised more than $14 million, which generated scholarships, research opportunities, and state of the art facilities that enable our students to achieve their goals. With your help, we will continue to grow and shape the lives of our students.  I invite you to explore this website to learn all the ways you can engage with and support Cal State LA.
