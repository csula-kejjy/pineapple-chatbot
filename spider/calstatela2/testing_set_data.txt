After spending two years Institute Math Academia Sinica Taiwan a research assistant I came (1987-1991 ) South Carolina Columbia under supervision Jerry Griggs.

I am extremely honored be recipient 2015 MAA (Mathematical Association America) Southern California Nevada Sectional Distinguished Teaching Award well a recipient Cal State LA Outstanding Professor Award (2003) Distinguished Women Award (2016).TEACHING INTERESTSTeaching a fulfilling rewarding job! see student learn get interested subject make achievements best rewards ateacher.Duri ng past years I have taught more than two dozen math courses ranging from collage algebra graduate courses. Some years ago I created an upper division graph theory course which now offered annually. addition I have taught several graduate seminar courses on special topics mentored many student research projects undergraduate graduate students.I am interested incorporating effective teaching strategies into classes enhance student learning. Currently I am on a flipped classroom grant (jointly faculty from several Cal State campuses) funded by Department Education. RESEARCHResearch InterestsMy research interests are graph theory combinatorics. I have been on following topics:Graph coloring parameters distance graphs relations number theory problems: Relating chromatic number fractional chromatic number circular chromatic number distance graphs density integral sets missing differences parameter involved so called lonely runner conjecture applying connections solving open problems respectiveareas.Grap h labelings motivated by channel assignment problem: Radio labeling backbone coloring distance two labeling circular distance two labeling etc.Applying topology (Tucker Lemma Ky Fan Lemma Borsuk-Ulam Theorem etc) study graph coloringproblems.Grap hs colorings: Vertex coloring circular coloring fractional coloring list-coloring strong edge-coloring on-line coloring ofgraphs.Curr ently research partially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) under a grant entitled Graph Coloring Choosability (2016-2019 ) I am a faulty mentor NASA CSULA Direct STEM grant (2015-2020 ).PublicationsLiu Grant Robinson Integral sequences three missing separations.

Currently I serve a member CSULA Rehabilitation Counseling Program Community Advisory Board CSULA Veterans Advisory Committee have served sub-committee chair CSULA Annual Veterans Forum. addition I am advisor Rehabilitation Counseling Association a student organization a co-advisor CSULA Golden Eagle Vets a student veteran organization a local chapter Student Veteran Association. Furthermore I serve a board member Honor Society Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society Pi Lambda Theta. I have been involved rehabilitation education recruitment efforts an emphasis on community college student transitions CSULA 2004. I believe rehabilitation education training ground some most rewarding positions helping professions. I also believe education plays a significant role minimizing violence abuse against people disabilities. Together we can make a difference!TEACHING INTERESTSBesides teaching rehabilitation education courses I teach counseling theories counseling higher education child maltreatment family violence research program evaluationcourses.RESE ARCHMy research interests have been areas violence against people disabilities a stress on proficiency development helping professionals area transitional issues veterans medical psychosocial aspects disabilities.

I have fun classes helping future teachers connect theory real world practice.(new knowledge bases) favorite course was EDCI 525: Integrated Mathematics Science Methodological Content Literacy. todays focus on STEM our societys need collaborative teachers I see course most important LAUTR program. There very little written about area research teaching; so together students I wrote a textbook future LAUTR students. I continue planning ways integrate STEM grade levels.(use technology) I continue improve courses I have taught many years. EDEL 419 - Curriculum Teaching Social Science - was one first courses I taught Charter College Education. Over years I have used WebCT Blackboard Moodle supplements course. one time I tried it a hybrid (half online half face-to-face). stated by Dr. Keane emeritus faculty mathematics education “As a person has emphasized technology teaching learning I think Dr. Arvedson doing an outstanding job area.”topResearchI continue lead research high school student teams satellite data make sense global climate change (Multinational Youth Studying Practical Applications Climatic Events). program was created designed by response student teacher needs Satellites & Education Conference. I connect our credential candidate students program an example collaborative integration STEM levels public school. M.Y. S.P.A.C.E. an international collaboration high school students engaged self-selected research projects on local impact global environmental issues. Students their own trained (I train them) Teacher Leaders their school sites using locally generated satellite-based data support from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA). Teams from each school meet annual Satellites & Education Conference discover global trends their collective data present their findings. Students practice techniques scientific investigation; methods data processing analysis interpretation; leadership; effective communication. They NOAA NASA scientists engineers experience campus life can apply special internships Cal State L.A. I created program 2002 continue direct program train teachers must have a letter support from their principals enter program. Three other major areas research are: 1) mathematical understanding by young children language impairments 2) impact cohorts teacher education 3) a comparison teacher training South Africa United States specifically California. numerical understanding young children research has been published several journals. cohorts teacher education article review comparison South Africa United States a collaborative effort colleagues South Africa still process beingwritten.topR ecent PublicationsArvedson P.

Communication between cells important during embryonic development defects signaling pathways are frequently associated disease adults. Thus understanding causes craniofacial birth defects progress developing therapeutics adult disease are hindered by our incomplete understanding how cells normally process signalinginformation.The success vertebrate lineage owes partly acquisition jaws. structures jaw apparatus directly relate function. Jaw development begins cranial neural crest cells migrate from neural tube into transient embryonic structures called pharyngeal pouches. neural crest cells surrounded by first pharyngeal pouch form chondrocytes become upper lower embryonic jaw cartilages. adult craniofacial skeleton forms later through elaborating upon largely replacing embryonic jawcartilages.The Endothelin-1 (Edn1) signaling pathway required lower jaw formation. Edn1 signal emanates from pharyngeal pouches instruct neural crest cells. First Edn1 ligand binds a G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) on neural crest cells couples a G-alpha-q factor communicate a Phospholipase C (PLC) family member. Next PLC stimulation leads activation a group transcription factors further modulate expression a downstream network genes. Hence we understand series events set motion by Edn1 signal fairly well.

We aspire contribute understanding mechanisms regulate normal differentiation order enable development successful medical approaches developmental disorders cancer. Our model system muscle development or myogenesis. We currently have three major projects. first project uses whole animals molecular studies test hypothesis either generally expressed tumor suppressor transcription factor p53 or muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD must be expressed successful completion myogenesis vivo. second asks whether recently discovered MyoD binding sites found downstream skeletal muscle actin gene together well-known binding sites upstream gene regulate efficiency its expression. We are using plasmid reporter constructs myogenic cells culture answer question. third project asks whether MyoD bound upstream Id2 Id3 genes contribute efficiency their expression during proliferation transition differentiation. Id proteins inhibit differentiation. We are using cell lines do or do not express MyoD together reporter assays answer thisquestion.Dr . Sharp has had good fortune have had many wonderful students her lab. Some have gone on complete advanced degrees. Many are making their contributions industry academia health professions.
