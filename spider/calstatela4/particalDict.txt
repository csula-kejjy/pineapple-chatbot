After spending two years Institute Math Academia Sinica Taiwan a research assistant I came (1987-1991 ) South Carolina Columbia under supervision Jerry Griggs. Ever joined Cal State LA faculty 1991 I have been pursuing teaching research goals. I am extremely honored be recipient 2015 MAA (Mathematical Association America) Southern California Nevada Sectional Distinguished Teaching Award well a recipient Cal State LA Outstanding Professor Award (2003) Distinguished Women Award (2016).TEACHING INTERESTSTeaching a fulfilling rewarding job! see student learn get interested subject make achievements best rewards ateacher.Duri ng past years I have taught more than two dozen math courses ranging from collage algebra graduate courses. Some years ago I created an upper division graph theory course which now offered annually. addition I have taught several graduate seminar courses on special topics mentored many student research projects undergraduate graduate students.I am interested incorporating effective teaching strategies into classes enhance student learning. Currently I am on a flipped classroom grant (jointly faculty from several Cal State campuses) funded by Department Education. RESEARCHResearch InterestsMy research interests are graph theory combinatorics. I have been on following topics:Graph coloring parameters distance graphs relations number theory problems: Relating chromatic number fractional chromatic number circular chromatic number distance graphs density integral sets missing differences parameter involved so called lonely runner conjecture applying connections solving open problems respectiveareas.Grap h labelings motivated by channel assignment problem: Radio labeling backbone coloring distance two labeling circular distance two labeling etc.Applying topology (Tucker Lemma Ky Fan Lemma Borsuk-Ulam Theorem etc) study graph coloringproblems.Grap hs colorings: Vertex coloring circular coloring fractional coloring list-coloring strong edge-coloring on-line coloring ofgraphs.Curr ently research partially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) under a grant entitled Graph Coloring Choosability (2016-2019 ) I am a faulty mentor NASA CSULA Direct STEM grant (2015-2020 ).PublicationsLiu Grant Robinson Integral sequences three missing separations.

I have fun classes helping future teachers connect theory real world practice.(new knowledge bases) favorite course was EDCI 525: Integrated Mathematics Science Methodological Content Literacy. todays focus on STEM our societys need collaborative teachers I see course most important LAUTR program. There very little written about area research teaching; so together students I wrote a textbook future LAUTR students. I continue planning ways integrate STEM grade levels.(use technology) I continue improve courses I have taught many years. EDEL 419 - Curriculum Teaching Social Science - was one first courses I taught Charter College Education. Over years I have used WebCT Blackboard Moodle supplements course. one time I tried it a hybrid (half online half face-to-face). stated by Dr. Keane emeritus faculty mathematics education “As a person has emphasized technology teaching learning I think Dr. Arvedson doing an outstanding job area.”topResearchI continue lead research high school student teams satellite data make sense global climate change (Multinational Youth Studying Practical Applications Climatic Events). program was created designed by response student teacher needs Satellites & Education Conference.

Jaw development begins cranial neural crest cells migrate from neural tube into transient embryonic structures called pharyngeal pouches. neural crest cells surrounded by first pharyngeal pouch form chondrocytes become upper lower embryonic jaw cartilages. adult craniofacial skeleton forms later through elaborating upon largely replacing embryonic jawcartilages.The Endothelin-1 (Edn1) signaling pathway required lower jaw formation.

We aspire contribute understanding mechanisms regulate normal differentiation order enable development successful medical approaches developmental disorders cancer. Our model system muscle development or myogenesis. We currently have three major projects. first project uses whole animals molecular studies test hypothesis either generally expressed tumor suppressor transcription factor p53 or muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD must be expressed successful completion myogenesis vivo. second asks whether recently discovered MyoD binding sites found downstream skeletal muscle actin gene together well-known binding sites upstream gene regulate efficiency its expression. We are using plasmid reporter constructs myogenic cells culture answer question. third project asks whether MyoD bound upstream Id2 Id3 genes contribute efficiency their expression during proliferation transition differentiation. Id proteins inhibit differentiation. We are using cell lines do or do not express MyoD together reporter assays answer thisquestion.Dr . Sharp has had good fortune have had many wonderful students her lab. Some have gone on complete advanced degrees. Many are making their contributions industry academia health professions.
